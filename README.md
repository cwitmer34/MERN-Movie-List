# MERN-Movie-List
Movie list project for NORCS bootcamp

This is milestone project 2 for our Software Development Bootcamp Program. This is created by Bolatito Ayanbajo, Zachary Landry, Amanda Remo, and Connor Witmer.

For this project, we created a website called "movielist" where users are able to see the list of movies and add/delete movies to the list. This website can be used in various ways such as using the list for movies they have seen before or movies that they are planning to watch in the future, & etc.
